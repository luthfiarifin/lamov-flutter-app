With excellent performances across the board, William Eubank employs fast pacing, high-intensity shootout sequences with a few interesting stylistic choices, and basic yet riveting storytelling.\r\n\r\nCharacter development and thematic depth remain surface-level, and the third act’s plot conveniences contrast with the realism of previous segments, but the film ultimately accomplishes what it promised, providing enough moments of tension empowered by a potent score to still reach the shore.\"\r\n\r\nRating: B-",

You can figure out if you like this movie by the box art. Didn't really believe the main plot shift or the disposition of the lead. Would have scored 2 higher if it was 30 minutes shorter. Basketball/pregnancy side plot would have been an easy way to cut all that. Get out the chair skinny boy. Fatties know how to drone.",

            "content": "Land of Bad is yet another bland production line, pro US military, action flick.\r\n\r\nComing kitted out with the usual pro US exceptionalism and bad guys who have a valid point about imperialism but are still \"bad\" anyway, this film offers nothing even remotely original or in this reviewers opinion, terribly likeable.\r\n\r\nThe characters are your usual array of entitled, obnoxious, US military types, who go on a flawed escapade in someone else's country to retrieve a CIA asset. Things turn sour and well the rest is your by the book, bravado, darning do, bravery, codswallop.\r\n\r\nFight scenes are frenetic, well paced and impressive. Lots of pyrotechnics and slow motion bullet and shell casing shots.Certainly from an exposition point of view, this film is not dull. \r\n\r\nActing is unremarkable but its the story that really leaves a lot to be desired. Putting aside its predictable bias, this tale is cliched, pedestrian and utterly predictable. Its essentially, every stale, second rate, US military action flick, you have ever seen with Australians and New Zealanders, in the lead.  \r\n\r\nIn summary, a film loaded down with tired pro US sentiment that's thoroughly unoriginal. Really only watchable in terms of its admittedly fast paced and elaborate, exposition.",
